# Pixel 2 Experience
I made a compilation of the different mods and came up with this Pixel 2 Experience module which can be flashed with other devices on Nougat.

## Information
As a Mi A1 user, I was stuck with Stock Oreo 8.0.0 without Oreo custom ROMs when I first bought my device. Kernel sources weren't released at the time so I decided if I can cook up a Magisk module that can bring me the Pixel Experience ROM without the need to install that certain ROM. What I did is to search around the internet which lead me to several mods on XDA, GitHub and other websites which have extracted files from the Pixel 2 devices. I've decided to gather them and compiled them all into a single Magisk Module. This module can be flashed with other devices on Nougat and above as well.

## STEPS TO ENABLE NIGHT LIGHT
You need to type this code via adb (connect your device to the PC with USB Debugging enabled)

adb shell cmd overlay enable --user 0 android.res.night

then reboot your device.

## PROPER STEPS TO UNINSTALL MODULE
In order to avoid bootloops after removing the module, you will need to remove all overlays. Go to Magisk Manager and uninstall the module then reboot to TWRP. Flash the Rescue zip found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iQ1FPdZElIqisCQPwJIIknnMh8UOwSjD/view?usp=drivesdk) to remove all remaining overlays. You should be able to reboot without any problems afterwards!
