# Pixel Experience
I made a compilation of the different mods and came up with this Pixel Experience module which can be flashed with other devices on Nougat.

## Information
As a Mi A1 user, I was stuck with Stock Oreo 8.0.0 without Oreo custom ROMs when I first bought my device. Kernel sources weren't released at the time so I decided if I can cook up a Magisk module that can bring me the Pixel Experience ROM without the need to install that certain ROM. What I did is to search around the internet which lead me to several mods on XDA, GitHub and other websites which have extracted files from the Pixel 2 devices. I've decided to gather them and compiled them all into a single Magisk Module. This module can be flashed with other devices on Nougat and above as well.

## Reminders
To avoid Launcher being renamed/crashing, disable the launcher you installed and switch to different launcher before disabling/uninstalling the module. Not doing so could result in a “0.0dip has stopped working" bug. If you do encounter this bug, try installing the real Pixel Launcher from the [Google Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.nexuslauncher).

If you encounter bootloop when uninstalling the module, you need to flash the Rescue zip found [here](https://androidfilehost.com/?fid=673368273298925325) to disable all overlays. You should be able to reboot without any problems afterwards!
